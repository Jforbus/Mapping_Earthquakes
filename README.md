# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
Using Leaflet to vizualize recent earthquake data on an interactive map.

### Resources
- Data Source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes
- Software : VS Code v1.71.2, leaflet.js v1.9.2, d3.js v5.5.0

## Results
The map displays all earthquakes for the last 7 days, major earthquakes for the last 7 days (magnitude greater than 4.5), along with the borders of the tectonic plates. The marker for each earthquake is has a size and color that corresponds with it's magnitude, as well as a popup that displays the magnitude and location of each earthquake. Their are 3 different map options selectable in a layer control feature, along with toggles for each dataset displayed on the map. At load all 3 data sets are present, but users can select which data is seen through the layer control feature.
